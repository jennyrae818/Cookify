# User Story

As a User I want to see a visually appealing easy to navigate welcome page with recipe images.
I want to beable to navigate to the next page that lists the ingrideints of a recipe and shows me where I can find them.


Given I want to see a recipe and where to find ingredients
When I select a recipe(or if one is already displayed)
Then it displays the ingredient list.
When it displays the list
Then I can see where(store and location) I can purchase these items.

When the items are displayed
Then the price is too

Given I want to save the list to the 'saved recipes'
When I click 'save recipe'
Then It saves it to 'saved recipes' for later.
